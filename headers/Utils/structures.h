     *        This vector will also work as a queue and a stack as it implements
     *        push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back. push_back is amortized O(1), whereas push_front
     *        is O(N). This means, use push_back when possible. Furthermore, pop_back is O(1) whereas
     *        pop_front is O(N).

     * @brief This is a deque implementation.
     * 
     * @note One of the advantages to using a deque compared to the vector (for my implementation)
     *       Is that for small amounts of data, the deque will be more effient. The deque will
     *       have the first container for data statically allocated, and after that will be
     *       dynamically allocated. This means there will be few dynamic writes, and deleting / adding
     *       should happen in a fast manner. 
     * 
     * @note If iteration is needed, then a vector will be better as the deque suffers from poor
     *       spacial locality. If a queue of stack is needed with constant writes and removals, then the
     *       deque is the way to go with O(1) push and pop operations. 
     * 
     * @note The plan is to implement O(1) random deletion in the deque. I am figuring out the best
     *       way to go about implementing this still, so there is currently no form of random deletion.
